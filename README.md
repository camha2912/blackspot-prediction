# Project Name: Predicting Blackspots for VicCrashAnalytics

## Purpose

This project aims to apply supervised machine learning and Python skills to develop a predictive model that identifies factors contributing to blackspots (accident hotspots) on roads. By analyzing the provided dataset, the goal is to gain insights, create a predictive model, evaluate its performance, and offer recommendations based on the findings. This project will enhance your understanding of machine learning, data analysis, and digital literacy, and give you practical experience in delivering solutions to real-world business problems.

## Context/Scenario

VicCrashAnalytics is a fictitious data consulting firm working with the Victorian government's Department of Transport (DOT). The project involves analyzing a dataset comprising information about blackspots, demographic characteristics of road segments, and related attributes. The primary objective is to uncover patterns and insights from the data, predict the risk of blackspots, and provide actionable recommendations for DOT's interventions.

**Datasets Provided:**
- Blackspot.csv: Contains data related to blackspots and road segment characteristics.
- Metadata.csv: Provides metadata information about the features in the dataset.
